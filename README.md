# Wave Simulator

This is a cellular simulation of transverse waves in a flat medium, with the ability to customize the medium and landscape in which the waves propogate. It is especially interesting because while physics is often studied at the macroscopic level, this sim displays that often those high-level observations emerge from much simpler processes. 

Each cell in this simulation is attracted to the height of the neighboring cells, and in turn attracts its neighbors down towards it, conserving momentum. This gives rise to wave superposition, reflection, and interference.
