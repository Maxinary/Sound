			Wave Dynamics
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Uh... what?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Sometime in Honors Physics we covered wave dynamics in the context of earthquakes, learning about the difference between transverse and longitudinal waves. Later, we learned about the propogation of 1d waves in a string, and how that could be described using sinusoidal motion. This is a simulation which mixes the two, showing how transverse waves propogate in 2 dimensions.

			How does it work?
		</h2>
		<p>
			This is built on 128x128 cells which act individually. Each one looks at the relative height of cells surrounding it, and pulls itself towards their average while pulling those cells up towards it equally. From this process emerges the wave system.

		<h2>
			But why?
		</h2>
		<p>
			In physics class, especially lower level physics classes, we learn about the way that simple systems work on a high level, which is important to describe complex systems. However, recognizing that there are underlying simpler rules governing how a system functions can lead to a more thorough understanding of those simple rules and when they are applicable. Describing the sinusoidal nature of wave dynamics is accurate, but seeing it exhibited by a set of simple cellular rules displays their truer, emergent nature.
